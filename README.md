                                              Property Tax Assessment 

Problem description:

  The Municipal Council is currently grappling with challenges related to property tax assessments, with citizens frequently contesting the complexity of the assessment procedure. There are concerns about the system's fairness and the burdensome filing requirements for assessment challenges. In response, the Council aims to streamline the tax assessment process by implementing a more rational and objective approach.

  The existing system relies on various factors such as location, building class, area (land and/or buildup), and year of construction to determine assessed property values. The Council acknowledges the need for consistency and fairness in these assessments and aims to address the issue by leveraging predictive modeling. This involves automating the property valuation process to create a more standardized and unbiased system.

   To further enhance the effectiveness of the tax assessment system, the Council is considering structuring benefit programs based on statistically significant variables. These programs are designed to incentivize activities like additional construction, property conversion, or modification, with the goal of reducing tax burdens and making proposed projects more economically viable.

   In summary, the Municipal Council's objective is to establish a fair, consistent, and automated property tax assessment system. By incorporating predictive modeling and targeted benefit programs, the Council aims to address citizen concerns, simplify the assessment procedure, and encourage positive property-related activities.

Error Metric : MAPE

  The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) stands out as a widely utilized Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for assessing the accuracy of forecasts. In essence, MAPE is determined by summing up the absolute errors for each forecasted data point and then dividing this total by the corresponding demand for each period. This calculation yields the average percentage error across all periods.

  To calculate MAPE for a set of data entries, start by finding the absolute percent error for each entry (the absolute difference between the forecasted and actual values, expressed as a percentage of the actual value). Once you have these individual absolute percent errors, add them together. Finally, divide this sum by the total number of errors to obtain the MAPE.

  In simpler terms, MAPE provides a measure of how accurate a forecasting method is by looking at the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values. The lower the MAPE, the more accurate the forecasting model is considered to be.
